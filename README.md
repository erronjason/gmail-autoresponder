# A Gmail app-scripts autoresponder

Read autoresponder.js for an idea of how to use it.

_For now, be wary of running this without setting a time constraint, or it will respond to __all__ your emails_.

Setting it up is as easy as going to Google Drive, New > More > Google Apps Script, and pasting in autoresponder.js. Set this to run as often as you need.
